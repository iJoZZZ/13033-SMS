# 13033-SMS-Movement-Permit
This app was created to facilitate users during the Greek lockdown of autumn 2020 to generate the required SMS for their movement permit.

During the Greek lockdown of autumn 2020, citizens were required to request a movement permit via the 13033 SMS service. To do so they would compose an SMS in the format of "X FullName Address" and send it to the recipient "13033". X would be a number between 1-6 depending on their reason of movement and the official guidelines.   
eg. for physical exercise outdoors the user should send "6 John Doe JohnDoesAddress".

The app shows a list of the available reasons of movement with an icon and a short description for each.  
At the personal info tab the user stores his info.  
User taps their selection and the SMS is auto-composed with the recipient and SMS body.
